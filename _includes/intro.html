Hello, my name is Rose Dufresne. Come along as you get to know me through this website! 

I am a 25 year old woman, with a bachelor's degree in computer science and a minor in game design currently working at Ubisoft as a gameplay developer. Being a person that is always interested in learning new skills and determined at completing challenges to the best of my ability, I am always interested in pursuing any opportunity to expand my knowledge in the field of computer science and software engineering.

During my experience at Concordia University and my job at Ubisoft, I've learned to appreciate many aspects of computer science over the years. For example, I love to use mathematical and physics concepts to simulate real life behaviours in software applications, which is why I gained a great appreciation to numerical methods that help these concepts become feasible in a digital medium. Because of my love for mathematical concepts and art, I've also gained a particular interest in computer graphics and animation programming. In fact, so much so that I am always actively pushing myself to learn more about these subjects to be able to one day pursue a career closely related to them in the future.

Thanks to my game design minor and my experience as a gameplay developer, I also had the opportunity to combine the very technical aspects of programming with art! I have always been a very artistic person and I absolutely didn't want to let my talents go to waste, which is why I am very interested in creating games. It perfectly combines the mathematical and logical aspects of computer science with art, something that is very hard to find in professional fields.

One of my competences is my ability to learn new things very quickly. I never shy away from asking relevant questions when needed and I never let myself be intimidated by the tasks I need to complete. I push myself through them and always ultimately get things done quickly and on time. 

Lastly, something you should know about me is that I am very passionate about helping others learn more about programming and the fantastic ways I've found how to combine technology and art. I strive to inspire new programmers to find a career path they will love and to help them when they need it. This is why I actively organize and participate in networking events such as game jams, hackathons and conferences where I host workshops, mentor and attend as a speaker. I do this completely voluntarily because I know how hard it is to take the steps to find a career you love and I want to share my own experiences with others to find the same success I have.
