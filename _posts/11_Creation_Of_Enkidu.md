2020, as the name suggests, is a horror game. 2020 has been a hard year for all of us, but the worst has definitely been the lockdown caused by the coronavirus. In this game, for almost 3 months you have been doing what you have been told by every news media: self isolation. However, you are starting to forget what the outside world looks like. For this reason, you decide to go out for some fresh air. Upon exiting your house, you come to the reaslisation that the outside world is not how you remember... The gameplay is simple: keep your social distancing!

This game was made with 3 other team members for Concordia's online game jam on May 17th 2020 with the theme "PANIC". I created some of the assets, including the infected people stuck on the walls, the mini covid monsters that appear on your visor, as well as the giant mother covid at the end of the maze. I also coded core gameplay attributes such as your life draining the longer you get exposed from standing too close to infected wall people and all of the UI. I also did all of the particle effects.
