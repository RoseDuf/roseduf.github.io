Treasure Diver 
(Made using Unity and C#)

First game I made using Unity. This is a 2D variation of Balloon Fight. In this variation, rather than being set in air, the game takes place under water, with the balloons being replaced by oxygen cylinders that help you breathe under water. The goal of the game is to get as much gold from the bottom of the ocean and to bring it back up to your boat. Enemies are replaced by sharks (moving around in straight lines), which can damage the player. There is also a moving octopus appearing once in a while to try and kill the player. Both the sharks and octopus move from one side of the screen to the other, and disappear after a fixed time.
