Chicken Rush
(Made using Processing)

This was my final project for my Computation Arts I class (CART 253). We were given complete creative freedom to create a game from scratch and this is what I chose to do. It is a competitive two player game where each player in the game plays as a very confused chicken desperately trying to survive by trying to find the most food as possible before the other. These chickens have absolutely no sense of orientation and constantly turn in circles until a player tells them to go in a given direction. However, the player needs to time the orientation of the chicken at the right moment to be able to get the correct angle towards a grain.

To win you have to eat the most seeds before the time is up. The more seeds, the more points you get.
