Description:

This was my very first 3D modeling and animation project that I had to do for my 3D digital design class. It is inspired by Pteropus bats, more commonly known as "Flying Foxes". I started by making a basic sculpt of the bat while making sure to have uniform quad polygons all accross the model. I then proceeded with the texturing, materials and colors using references and added fur which wasn't required for the class. I then added HDR lighting, and finally animated it flying in a natural manner. 

I really enjoyed making this project and would like to further my knowledge in 3D animation in the future. I have used Unity in the class and am planning on getting more experience with that engine to make models such as this one and using them in games.
