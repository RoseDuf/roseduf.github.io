(Made using C++)

Description:

Project I made with 3 of my teammates. The goal was to recreate from scratch the game "PowerGrid" using object oriented programming concepts and C++ programming language. I am proud of this project because it has been one of my biggest coding projects so far and I did very well on it. It showed me that I am more than capable of working in a team, as I would constantly put in effort into improving our communication by using apps like discord and by making use of the "issues" functionality on github. Furthermore, I would always finish my tasks on time. So much so that I would put in extra time into the project if any of my teammates needed help. 

 When it comes to the structure of our code, there are a lot of things to go though. Click  <a href="https://github.com/RoseDuf/PowerGrid"> here</a> for more.
