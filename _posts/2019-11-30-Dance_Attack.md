Description:

This game was aiming to reflect how it feels to have anxiety in day to day life. Anxiety attacks can occur in situations where a person feels an incredible amount of pressure (either real of fabricated) and will fall into an endless loop of low self-esteem and hopelessness. The game achieves a representation of anxiety because it lets you increase your courage to do more complex dance moves, just like anyone else, but doing so increases the difficulty of the game. The increased difficulty represents how a person with anxiety will be more prone to getting stressed because of the added pressure of standing out in a crowd. The game also shows the playerâ€™s heartbeat which becomes faster if the player misses buttons. Additionally, the character herself will look visually more stressed if the player misses buttons. These are 2 direct visual representations of anxiety.
