Hot Coco
(Made using Unreal with Blueprint)

Tabascoco leads a peaceful life in its volcano, lying well under the shade of its palm tree. When suddenly, the volcano erupts!

To escape, Tabascoco will have to jump from platform to platform with means of propulsion that are... unconventional.

Hot Coco is a platform game with ragdoll physics. The game is randomly generated in a hand drawn tropical environnement. 

This game was made with 5 other team members for CGD club's and ETS Conjure's online game jam called "CoCo Jam" on September 11th 2020 with the theme "No Pain, No Gain". I programmed the ragdoll physics and some core gameplay mechanics such as losing and regaining limbs. I also helped with model creations such as the main character and level aesthetics and material implementation using Unreal's material editor.
