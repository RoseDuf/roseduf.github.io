Single player, first person shooter puzzle game which enacted the concept of the “domino effect” by challenging the player to destroy projectiles before they get the chance to explode and multiply in the room.

Description:

Chaosball is simple but enjoyable game where the premise is quite simple: there are crates you have to protect; let them disappear and you will disappear as well. Fortunately, you have your trusty Powderizer-5874 by your side to help you fight against this unusual threat presented in the form of flying spheres.

This game was made with 2 other team members for McGame Jam 2021 from January 15th to 17th with the theme "UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES". I designed the main concept of the game and did the level design. I was inspired by games such as "Bubble Trouble" and "Antichamber", but obviously gave it it's own twist. I also oversaw the implementation of the retro-style graphics using shader graphs and particle effects for visual effects. 

Rewards: Won 3rd place amongst 18 game submissions
