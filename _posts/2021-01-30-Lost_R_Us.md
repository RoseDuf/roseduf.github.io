This game was made with 4 other team members for the Global Game Jam 2021 from January 27th to 31th with the theme "LOST AND FOUND". I designed the main concept of the game and did the level design. I also did all of the art for the game using Blender for the 3D models and Sketchbook for the 2D assets. I also attained the comic book-styled graphics by tweaking lighting attributes and created all the art for the game. The idea behind the style was inspired by the game Doom, but given that you play through the eyes of a child we wanted to make it cartoony with bright colors.

Rewards: Won 2nd place amongst 52 game submissions!
