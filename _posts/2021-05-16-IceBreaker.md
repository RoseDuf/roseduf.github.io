Single player, top view, 3D rhythm game where you play as a penguin with a goal to seduce as many other penguins with your dancing skills.

Description:

It's breeding season for the penguins! And the biggest seduction event is in town: The Icebreaker! This great annual celebration will allow you to meet many partners, each one as charming as the next! However, to charm a partner, it will not be easy. Indeed, you will have to demonstrate your dancing skills!
Copy your opponent's moves to convince him / her, using good rhythm, to come with you! Try to gather as many mates as possible before the sun comes up!

Beware! If you ever fail to charm an opponent, all of your partners will be so ashamed of you that they will abandon you on the spot!
