(Made using Unity and C#)

You play the role of a new born moth larvae, embarked on a train amongst many other bugs. Estranged to this new environment, all you know to do is move forward from cabin to cabin to reach the front of the train. On your way, you meet new friends, and foes, that fill your life with events that further your maturity. You soon found out that this "journey" through the train echoes your life until you reach its end.

SpaceBar -> Interact

LeftMouseButton -> Dialogue

This game was made with 3 other team members for the Gamerella 2021 game jam from July 10th to 12th with the theme "JOURNEY". I designed the main concept of the game and did the level design. As the main programmer in the team, I developed all of the core gameplay, which includes the 3 mini-games put into the game: a trading game, a game that involves timing to save bugs from a spider's web prison and a dating simulator. I also mentored a student that just started game development for the first time. 

Reward: Together, my team an I won the “A Ride Through Life” reward amongst the 34 other game submissions!
