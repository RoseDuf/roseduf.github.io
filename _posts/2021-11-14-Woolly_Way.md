Description:

In this game, you will control sheepdogs who will have to guide their sheep to their enclosure. However, the task will not be so easy. You'll need to make sure your sheep don't get lost when exiting the screen, and you'll also need to fend off predators by barking until they run away.

So? Will you be able to brave the 6 levels so that you can proclaim yourself as the best sheepdog?

Controls:

- Left mouse click: Draw a route for your dog
- Right mouse click: Bark to speed up sheep or scare away predators
- Reset the level: R
- Skip a level: L

This game was made with 5 other team members for the CoCo Jam on May 17th 2020 with the theme "DIRECTION". I created all of the assets and SFX of the game using Blender for the models and ShaderGraph for the visual effects. I wanted to explore how to have a "retro look" in a game by pixelating the view. I achieved this by adding in a texture renderer to the camera view that reduced the resolution. This is an interesting trick to make a game have "pixel art" without needing to animate and create actual pixel art from scratch. I also did all of the level design and established the game design properties. 

Reward: We won 2nd place amongs 8 game submissions!
