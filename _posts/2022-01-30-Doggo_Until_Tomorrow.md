Description:

Have you ever wanted to control an adorable little dog? Well, enter this magical and flamboyant world to make your dream come true! In this cute game, you'll have to help the little villagers feed themselves by bringing them their favorite food! Watch as they thank you with their cute little voices! So what are you waiting for? Fill your basket and get ready for a surprising and adorable game in a fantastic universe! And who knows, maybe you'll discover that this game holds some secrets for you to discover... 

When night is reached, you will see your dual personality emerge. Feeding those villagers was just a farce! in fact, you were only fattening them up for you to eat them yourself when you turn into a werewolf! Only one thing to do in this faze... KILL THEM ALL!!! MOUAHAHAHHA!

This game was made with 4 other team members for the Global Game Jam 2022 from the 20th to the 30th of January with the theme "DUALITY". As a programmer, I implemented most of the core gameplay of this game; the the player's abilities and interactions with the villagers, the AI behaviour of the villagers, the changes in abilities during the transition between day and night and object pooling for the villagers and items that spawn. I also did the level design, established the game design properties and the toon shader effect using Unity's ShaderGraph tool. This is one of my proudest game jam submissions because, not only did we win a prize at 4th place amongst 35 submissions, it is also a game that never fails to make me laugh. It is silly, polished and fun. Nothing better than a game like that!

Reward: We won a prize for 4th place amongst 35 game submissions!
