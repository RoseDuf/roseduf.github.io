Super Shopper: Closing Time Rush 
(Made using Unity and C#)

Super Shopper: Closing Time Rush (SSCTR) is a wacky maze-like arcade action game that has the player running around a store buying items in order to complete a shopping list whilst taking advantage of coupons and avoiding obstacles and enemies. While the primary goal is to complete your shopping list, other items and coupons appear in the level which contribute to your score. There is also a time limit for each level, making it important to avoid the many obstacles and enemies which stun or hinder the player, causing them to lose time. There is a minimum score for each level that must be reached in order to unlock more levels.
