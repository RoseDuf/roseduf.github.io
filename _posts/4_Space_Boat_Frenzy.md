Space Boat Frenzy 
(Made using Unity and C#)

(*Note: game is a tad unfinished, we didn't have time to add an end or winning screen)

This game was made in the 2020 Global Game Jam at ETS. With 7 team members of all experience levels and strenghs, we worked hard to make our best interpretation of the theme "REPAIR". In this 2 person coop game, you work together to maintain your space boat as long as you possibly can. Your home planet, Earth, is inhabitable due to a climate catastrophe. Your only hope is to transport the last remaining tree to a new planet where humanity can thrive again. Unfortunatly, space is a dangerous place to navigate through. Space sharks do anything to try to destroy your ship, secured with a glass bottle, and to eat you! Because of these devious sharks, you have to constantly repair and manage your main ship elements. These are: the engine, the resource extractor, the powerplant, the storage room, the shield, the tree (oxygen provider), the water supply and the steering wheel. 

I was in charge of all things related to the resources that needed to get extracted in order to fix various parts of the ship (including assets, code and effects). I was also in charge of the sharks attacking the ship, including life gauge and changing states of each part of the ship. Of course I also helped with other aspects of the game as needed.
