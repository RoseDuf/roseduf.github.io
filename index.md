            <div class="intro">
                <p> 
                I am a fourth year student majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Game Design at Concordia University. Being a person that is always interested in learning new skills and determined at completing challenges to the best of my ability, I am very interested in pursuing any opportunity to expand my knowledge in my field.
                </p>
                <p>
                During my experience at Concordia University, I've learned to appreciate many aspects of computer science over the years. For example, I loved my course on theoretical computer science where I got to learn how turing machines worked and how computers interpreted different grammars. I also enjoyed data structures and algorithms because it was satisfying for me to see different sorting algorithm's effectiveness at play. Furthermore, I've gained a particular interest in computer graphics. In fact, so much so that I would love to pursue a job that is closely related to computer graphics in the near future.
                </p>
                <p>
                Thanks to my game design minor, I also had the opportunity to combine the very technical aspects of computer science with art! I have always been a very artistic person and I absolutely didn't want to let my talents go to waste, which is why I am very interested in creating games. It perfectly combines the mathematical and logical aspects of computer science with art, something that is very hard to find in professional fields.
                </p>
                <p>  
                When it comes to programming, one of my competences is my ability to learn new programming languages and softwares very quickly. Before applying to my major, I had no previous knowledge in coding. However, it only took me a couple of months to finally catch up to the standards of the classes I was taking, and even exceeded other students in my program.
