                    This was my very first 3D modeling and animation project that I had to do for my 3D digital design class. It is inspired by Pteropus bats, more commonly known as "Flying Foxes". I started by making a basic sculpt of the bat while making sure to have uniform quad polygons all accross the model. I then proceeded with the texturing, materials and colors using references and added fur which wasn't required for the class. I then added HDR lighting, and finally animated it flying in a natural manner.

                    I really enjoyed making this project and would like to further my knowledge in 3D animation in the future. I have used Unity in the class and am planning on getting more experience with that engine to make models such as this one and using them in games.

                This was my final project for my Computation Arts I class (CART 253). We were given complete creative freedom to create a game from scratch and this is what I chose to do. It is a competitive two player game where each player in the game plays as a very confused chicken desperately trying to survive by trying to find the most food as possible before the other. These chickens have absolutely no sense of orientation and constantly turn in circles until a player tells them to go in a given direction. However, the player needs to time the orientation of the chicken at the right moment to be able to get the correct angle towards a grain.

                How to play:

                <p>
                To control the white chicken you press "Shift" and to control the brown chicken you press the "Up" key.
                </p>
                <p>
                To win you have to eat the most seeds before the time is up. The more seeds, the more points you get.
