                    2020, as the name suggests, is a horror game. 2020 has been a hard year for all of us, but the worst has definitely been the lockdown caused by the coronavirus. In this game, for almost 3 months you have been doing what you have been told by every news media: self isolation. However, you are starting to forget what the outside world looks like. For this reason, you decide to go out for some fresh air. Upon exiting your house, you come to the reaslisation that the outside world is not how you remember... The gameplay is simple: keep your social distancing!
                </p> 
                <p>
                    This game was made with 3 other team members for Concordia's online game jam on May 17th 2020 with the theme "PANIC". I created some of the assets, including the infected people stuck on the walls, the mini covid monsters that appear on your visor, as well as the giant mother covid at the end of the maze. I also coded core gameplay attributes such as your life draining the longer you get exposed from standing too close to infected wall people and all of the UI. I also did all of the particle effects.

                    This game was made in the 2020 Global Game Jam at ETS. With 7 team members of all experience levels and strenghs, we worked hard to make our best interpretation of the theme "REPAIR". In this 2 person coop game, you work together to maintain your space boat as long as you possibly can. Your home planet, Earth, is inhabitable due to a climate catastrophe. Your only hope is to transport the last remaining tree to a new planet where humanity can thrive again. Unfortunatly, space is a dangerous place to navigate through. Space sharks do anything to try to destroy your ship, secured with a glass bottle, and to eat you! Because of these devious sharks, you have to constantly repair and manage your main ship elements. These are: the engine, the resource extractor, the powerplant, the storage room, the shield, the tree (oxygen provider), the water supply and the steering wheel. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    I was in charge of all things related to the resources that needed to get extracted in order to fix various parts of the ship (including assets, code and effects). I was also in charge of the sharks attacking the ship, including life gauge and changing states of each part of the ship. Of course I also helped with other aspects of the game as needed.

                    Super Shopper: Closing Time Rush (SSCTR) is a wacky maze-like arcade action game that has the player running around a store buying items in order to complete a shopping list whilst taking advantage of coupons and avoiding obstacles and enemies. While the primary goal is to complete your shopping list, other items and coupons appear in the level which contribute to your score. There is also a time limit for each level, making it important to avoid the many obstacles and enemies which stun or hinder the player, causing them to lose time. There is a minimum score for each level that must be reached in order to unlock more levels.

                    Second game I made using Unity. In this variation, you play in first person perspective in a 3D environment. This time, you found gold at the bottom of a deep sewer filled with mutated sharks. You can carry a bag of meat to distract the sharks. Why would you want to do this? Because if you have 15 points worth of gold, or more, sharks will start following you to try to hurt you! There is also a giant sea spider that spawns at the bottom, that can shoot projectiles at you! The goal is the same: get the most gold possible and bring it back up to you boat without dying.

                    First game I made using Unity. This is a 2D variation of Balloon Fight. In this variation, rather than being set in air, the game takes place under water, with the balloons being replaced by oxygen cylinders that help you breathe under water. The goal of the game is to get as much gold from the bottom of the ocean and to bring it back up to your boat. Enemies are replaced by sharks (moving around in straight lines), which can damage the player. There is also a moving octopus appearing once in a while to try and kill the player. Both the sharks and octopus move from one side of the screen to the other, and disappear after a fixed time.

                    This game was aiming to reflect how it feels to have anxiety in day to day life. Anxiety attacks can occur in situations where a person feels an incredible amount of pressure (either real of fabricated) and will fall into an endless loop of low self-esteem and hopelessness. The game achieves a representation of anxiety because it lets you increase your courage to do more complex dance moves, just like anyone else, but doing so increases the difficulty of the game. The increased difficulty represents how a person with anxiety will be more prone to getting stressed because of the added pressure of standing out in a crowd. The game also shows the playerâ€™s heartbeat which becomes faster if the player misses buttons. Additionally, the character herself will look visually more stressed if the player misses buttons. These are 2 direct visual representations of anxiety.

                    Project I made with 3 of my teammates. The goal was to recreate from scratch the game "PowerGrid" using object oriented programming concepts and C++ programming language. I am proud of this project because it has been one of my biggest coding projects so far and I did very well on it. It showed me that I am more than capable of working in a team, as I would constantly put in effort into improving our communication by using apps like discord and by making use of the "issues" functionality on github. Furthermore, I would always finish my tasks on time. So much so that I would put in extra time into the project if any of my teammates needed help.

                    This project was my final project in my Computer Graphics course. It was made individually and required me to make from scratch a ray-tracer that would be able to render circles, quads (for example: planes), and meshes (objects made from triangles). We had to compute realistic lighting and shadows using global illumination physics and the image space (as opposed to local illumation physics and the object space used in APIs such as OpenGL). Global illumination and image space mean, in short, that colors are rendered per individual pixel instead of per object. This means that the illumination and shadows are far more realistic than the ones produced by OpenGL. However, this also means that ray-tracing requires more intensive computation.

                        This was my very first 3D modeling and animation project that I had to do for my 3D digital design class. It is inspired by Pteropus bats, more commonly known as "Flying Foxes". I started by making a basic sculpt of the bat while making sure to have uniform quad polygons all accross the model. I then proceeded with the texturing, materials and colors using references and added fur which wasn't required for the class. I then added HDR lighting, and finally animated it flying in a natural manner.

                        I really enjoyed making this project and would like to further my knowledge in 3D animation in the future. I have used Unity in the class and am planning on getting more experience with that engine to make models such as this one and using them in games.

                    This was my final project for my Computation Arts I class (CART 253). We were given complete creative freedom to create a game from scratch and this is what I chose to do. It is a competitive two player game where each player in the game plays as a very confused chicken desperately trying to survive by trying to find the most food as possible before the other. These chickens have absolutely no sense of orientation and constantly turn in circles until a player tells them to go in a given direction. However, the player needs to time the orientation of the chicken at the right moment to be able to get the correct angle towards a grain.
